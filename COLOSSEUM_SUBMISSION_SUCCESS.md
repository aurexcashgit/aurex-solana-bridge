"Native Rust smart contract using Anchor framework with Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure escrow. Supports card creation, funding, payments, deactivation with multi-signature authorization. 400ms transaction finality, complete TypeScript SDK, REST API bridge with PostgreSQL backend, CLI tools for testing. Real-time event monitoring and cross-chain bridge architecture."

### Demo Instructions
**5-Minute Working Demo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurexcashgit/aurex-solana-bridge
cd aurex-solana-bridge
npm run setup && npm run deploy
npm run cli create-card --limit 100
```

### Additional Information
"🚀 5-MINUTE DEMO: git clone repo → npm run setup → npm run deploy → npm run cli create-card --limit 100. PRODUCTION READY: 6000+ lines, Docker containerized, complete test coverage, enterprise architecture. TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS: PDA-based security, multi-signature support, real-time monitoring, cross-chain ready. BUSINESS MODEL: 0.1% transaction fees, targeting 100M+ crypto users afraid to shop online with main wallets. FIRST MOVER: First virtual crypto cards on Solana blockchain."
